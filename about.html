    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>Hi, I’m Scott Lee, a Game Programmer and Web Developer with a passion for building immersive experiences and modern, user-friendly websites. With 6+ years of experience in front-end development and game programming, I’ve honed my skills in Unreal Engine 5 (C++ and Blueprints), WordPress development, and UI/UX design. I’m currently pursuing a second bachelor’s degree in Computer Science to expand my technical expertise and deepen my knowledge in areas like algorithms, software development, and system architecture. Whether it’s developing gameplay features for a 3D fantasy game or optimizing a business website for SEO and accessibility, I love solving complex problems and bringing creative visions to life.</p>
    <h2>My Skillset</h2>
    <ul>Game Development: Unreal Engine 5, C++, Blueprints, Multiplayer Systems, Game Optimization</ul>
    <ul>Web Development: WordPress, Custom Websites, Mobile Responsiveness, SEO, ADA Compliance</ul>
    <ul>Tools & Technologies: Git, Google Analytics, Visual Studio, Figma</ul>
    <p>Beyond coding, I’m also a Jiu-Jitsu enthusiast and have a deep love for fantasy and Japanese culture, which often inspires my creative projects. I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy working on projects that challenge me to think outside the box. If you’d like to collaborate or learn more about my work, feel free to reach out!</p>
