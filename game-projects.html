      <h3>Fantasy RP Game</h3>
      <p>A fully immersive role-playing experience developed in Unreal Engine 5 using Blueprints and C++. This game invites players to craft their own stories and live out unique adventures by stepping into the roles of their characters. Players can own and operate shops, craft weapons and armor, build and personalize homes, explore a vast open world, and much more.

        The ultimate goal is to deliver an authentic isekai experience, transporting players to a richly detailed fantasy world where their imagination sets the limits!</p>

      <h3>Multiplayer FPS Game</h3>
      <p>Unreal Engine 5 with C++ and Blueprints. This project was developed to hone my multiplayer development skillset. I created an online shooter where players could search for and connect to lobbies, engage in combat with a few modern style guns, and players would be scored based on kills and deaths.</p>

      <h3>Urban Fantasy (SNHU Project)</h3>
      <p>While working toward my Game Programming and Development Bachelor's Degree, I worked in a team of 5, my role was the UIX and SFX developer. I sourced royalty free music and sound effects while building the UIX. The Main Menu, Pause Menu, and Player HUD were developed and designed as my responsibility. I also aided our Project Leader with Git as it was a learning experience for him. I taught our group to utilize Git as version control. We built this game using Unreal Engine 5 with Blueprints.</p>

      <h3>Teeth (SNHU Project)</h3>
      <p>This was a solo developed game as part of a class. The game was a looter/shooter style zombie survival game built in Unreal Engine 5 with Blueprints. The player was to survive a zombie hoard and make it to the boss, a dentist that was converting people into zombies! The player had to find a weapon and use limited amount of ammo to make it to the boss fight and defeat the "Dentist" who was the final boss.</p>
